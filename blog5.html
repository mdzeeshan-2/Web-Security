                <h2>
                  CVE-2024–21626: The runC Container Vulnerability
                </h2>
                <p>CVE-2024–21626 is notable for its effect on the runC component, a crucial aspect of numerous open-source container management systems. This security flaw enables an attacker to gain access to the host filesystem by exploiting leaked file descriptors in runC versions up to 1.1.11.
                </p>
                  <br>
            
                  <div class="post-image">
                    <a href="#">
                      <img alt="" src="assets/images/Blogs/img19.webp">
                    </a>

                  <h2>Technical aspects:
                  </h2>
                  
                  <p>
                    The core of CVE-2024-21626 can be attributed to a file descriptor leak in the runC package. This problem arises when running container code. Although users commonly configure file descriptors to close upon execution (O_CLOEXEC) to avoid leakage, a vulnerability exists in the way runC manages the setcwd(2) system call. <br> <br>
The unintentional action of runC is to retain an open file descriptor when establishing the present working directory. This vulnerability enables a container to retain a connection to this descriptor, particularly if the working directory is set as a path resolved through this leaked descriptor. The problem is further intensified by the fact that the non-dumpable bit, which provides a level of security by restricting other users from accessing the process's memory or state, is unset after execve. As a result, there are numerous avenues for potential attacks, extending beyond inadequately configured systems.


                  </p>
                  <h2>Implications
                  </h2>
                  <p>The consequences of this vulnerability are substantial. It has the potential to enable a container to break free from its designated boundaries and engage with the host's file system. This level of access could empower an attacker to view, alter, or erase system files, which could result in elevated privileges or additional exploitation of the host system.
                  </p>
                  <h2>CVE-2024–21626 attack vectors
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    Attack 1 — process.cwd “Mis-Configuration”: The attack method described here exploits the leaked file descriptor of a host's directory (such as /sys/fs/cgroup). By setting the working directory of a container to a specific path associated with this file descriptor, the attacker gains access to the entire filesystem of the host. This vulnerability can be taken advantage of by using a malicious image or Dockerfile. <br> <br> 
Attack 2 — runc exec Container Breakout:Attack 1 can be modified by employing a different approach, wherein the attacker deceives either an administrative process or a user into utilizing  runc exec with a specific --cwd argument that is associated with a leaked file descriptor. This method is more practical to execute since it necessitates less user engagement when compared to Attack 1.<br> <br> 
Attacks 3a and 3b — Process.args Host Binary Overwrite Attack: These attacks involve overwriting host binaries by executing a path like /proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash as the process.args binary argument in a container. This method allows an attacker to overwrite critical host binaries, facilitating full control over the host system.<br> 

                  </p>
                  <h2>Mitigation and Patching
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    To effectively protect against this vulnerability, it is crucial to close all unnecessary file descriptors prior to executing container code. This precautionary step necessitates careful configuration and ongoing maintenance of the container environment.<br>
                    Action must be taken promptly to address this vulnerability. RunC has resolved this problem in version 1.1.12 by ensuring that the directory specified in the WORKDIR directive is located within the container's root filesystem. Additionally, privileged host directory file descriptors are now closed immediately after use. Updated versions that include these patches have been released by AWS, Ubuntu, and other prominent platforms.
                    
                  </p>
                  <h2>CVE-2024–23651, CVE-2024–23652, and CVE-2024–23653: The Docker BuildKit Vulnerabilities</h2>
                  <p>In addition to CVE-2024–21626, BuildKit has been found to have three more vulnerabilities, namely CVE-2024–23651, CVE-2024–23652, and CVE-2024–23653. These vulnerabilities impact versions up to 0.12.4.
                  </p>
                  <h2>
                    The Nature of the BuildKit Vulnerabilities

                  </h2>
                  <p>BuildKit, a sophisticated build engine designed for Docker, encountered notable vulnerabilities in versions prior to 0.12.4. These vulnerabilities, specifically identified as CVE-2024–23651, CVE-2024–23652, and CVE-2024–23653, pose distinct yet interrelated risks during the process of constructing Docker images.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    CVE-2024–23651 — Cache Mounts Race Condition: The race condition caused by shared cache mounts gives rise to this vulnerability. If two build steps are executed simultaneously and share cache mounts, it creates a possibility for files from the host system to be accessed by the build container. Exploiting this vulnerability is possible when a user tries to build a Dockerfile from a malicious project.<br><br>
CVE-2024–23652 — Malicious BuildKit Frontend/Filesystem Tampering: The problem at hand pertains to a malevolent BuildKit frontend or Dockerfile that exploits the RUN --mount command to deceive the mountpoint removal feature.
